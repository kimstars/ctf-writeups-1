### Solution

Thanks to this CTF, I found another way to hide information on a Discord channel.

If you check the emoji sections, there are 5 emojis named `flag-pepe`. Just put the text inside these emoji inside the `ISITDTU{}` and you get the flag.

Flag is:

```
ISITDTU{Welcome_to_ISITDTU-CTF-2022_GoodLuck}
```

_I didn't remember the correct flag, so forgive me if this is a false one._
