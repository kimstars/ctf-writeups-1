> Hiiiii, welcome to ASIS CTF. We have ducks. Check them out here Note for beginners: If you haven't played CTF before, this video might help you to understand what you have to do.

### Solution
Accessing the website, we were introduced with a website showing pictures of ducks. <br>
![The main website](website.png)

The given source code is:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from flask import Flask,request,Response
import random
import re

app = Flask(__name__)
availableDucks = ['duckInABag','duckLookingAtAHacker','duckWithAFreeHugsSign']
indexTemplate = None
flag = None

@app.route('/duck')
def retDuck():
	what = request.args.get('what')
	duckInABag = './images/e146727ce27b9ed172e70d85b2da4736.jpeg'
	duckLookingAtAHacker = './images/591233537c16718427dc3c23429de172.jpeg'
	duckWithAFreeHugsSign = './images/25058ec9ffd96a8bcd4fcb28ef4ca72b.jpeg'

	if(not what or re.search(r'[^A-Za-z\.]',what)):
		return 'what?'

	with open(eval(what),'rb') as f:
		return Response(f.read(), mimetype='image/jpeg')

@app.route("/")
def index():
	return indexTemplate.replace('WHAT',random.choice(availableDucks))

with open('./index.html') as f:
	indexTemplate = f.read() 
with open('/flag.txt') as f:
	flag = f.read()

if(__name__ == '__main__'):
	app.run(port=8000)
```

This is a Flask website with quite simple source code, so let's analyze it!
- Line 11 -> 22: This show the `/duck` site. First, it gets the argument passed to `what` to a variable called `what`. Then, in line 18, if `what` is empty or contains invalid character (which is checked by the regular expression `[^A-Za-z\.]`, the site will return `what?`. Otherwise, the `what` argument is passed into the `eval()` function, then will be opened, and will response to the user in the image form (check `mimetype`). <br>

- Line 24 -> 26: By default, when user visits the site, a random duck picture will be chosen, then responses to the user.
- Line 30 -> 31: The flag file is opened and passed to the variable `f`. But it doesn't close the file?

So the problem in this website is the `what` argument. User can pass anything which doesn't violate the regular expression to it, so how about passing a function to read the flag?

But the regular expression only allows letter from `a-z`, `A-Z` and the dot sign `.`. So we can only pass attribute of an object to `what`. The question now should be: *Which attribute of which object should I pass in?*

At runtime, we have 2 potential objects to play with:
1. Flask (response, request object)
2. The `f` variable in which the `flag.txt` file was passed

I tried all attribute of `response` and `request`, but all fails since I only get a 500 status code.
Moving on to the file object, there is a `name` attribute which seems to be interesting.
> Return the name of the file. It is a read-only attribute and may not be present on all file-like objects. If the file object was created using the open() function, the fileâ€™s name is returned. Otherwise, some string indicates the source of the file object is returned.

Since the content of the flag was assigned to the variable `f`, we can use this to exploit the website. 

The website now should be:
```
http://ducks.asisctf.com:8000/duck?what=f.name
```

![error](error.png)
Hmm, we got an error. As we have seen in the line 22, all files passed in the `open()` function is displayed with the mimetype `image/jpeg`. Therefore, let's try `curl`:

```bash
curl http://ducks.asisctf.com:8000/duck?what=f.name
```

We get the flag:
